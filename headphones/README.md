## Project Overview
This project is a responsive website implementation based on the Figma design specifications. The design features both desktop and mobile layouts with specific interaction states.

## Design Specifications

- **Fonts Required**:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/spin-cycle/) (Premium font)

## Development Requirements

### Layout
- **Max content width**: 1000px (centered on page)
- **Mobile breakpoint**: 480px and below
- **Responsive behavior**: Layout should adapt to mobile version when screen width â‰¤ 480px

### Interactions
| Element       | Hover/Active State          |
